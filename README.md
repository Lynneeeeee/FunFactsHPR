Welcome to our Fun Facts HPR website! This project is a React-based web application. The main purpose of this website is to provide a platform for sharing interesting facts about HPR (High-Power Rocketry), particularly related to my student rocket team (know more about HPR: https://www.monashhpr.com/).

## Features
1. Share Fun Facts: Users can share fun facts about HPR through our website. When posting a fact, they are required to provide a credible source and a subsection category.
   
2. Interact with Facts: Users can interact with posted fact by liking üëç, disliking ‚ùå, or marking it as mindblowing ü§Ø. If a fact receives too many dislikes, it will be marked as "‚ùóÔ∏èDISPUTED."
   
3. Browse by Subsection: All facts are displayed on the initial page, and users can navigate through 8 subsections (Business, Dynamics, Structures, Propulsion, Control, FlightSys and Payload) via the sidebar to view facts relevant to their interests.

## Technologies Used
Frontend: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React. Backend: Supabase
