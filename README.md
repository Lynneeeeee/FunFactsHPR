## Features
1. Share Fun Facts: You can share fun facts about HPR through the share by clicking the share button in the top right corner of the website. This will expand a form where you can fill in your fact along with a credible source and a subsection category. The form automatically records the word count (limited to 200 words) before publishing.

2. Once a fact is published, other users can interact with it by liking üëç, disliking ‚ùå, or marking it as mindblowing ü§Ø. Each user can only like a fact once per session. Once a vote is cast, the corresponding button becomes inactive and turns red. If a fact receives too many dislikes, it will be marked as '‚ùóÔ∏èDISPUTED'.
